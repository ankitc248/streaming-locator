"reviewBody": "My British/Irish humour puts me at variance with US comedy. This film was funny because of the subtlety and great acting. I rarely like films when a child tags along because often the child behaves with a pretence superior to the adults but in this film the young girl was outstanding and can be taken seriously and believable. This is one easy to follow adventure with lots of funny bits. The story is not the star, the cast and the way they blend is well done. Rarely do you see a film when the whole cast are brilliant.",
